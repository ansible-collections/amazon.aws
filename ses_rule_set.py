module: ses_rule_set
version_added: 1.0.0
short_description: Manages SES inbound receipt rule sets
description:
  - This module allows you to create, delete, and manage SES receipt rule sets
  - Prior to release 5.0.0 this module was called C(community.aws.aws_ses_rule_set).
    The usage did not change.
author:

  name:
    description:
      - The name of the receipt rule set.

      - Whether to create (or update) or destroy the receipt rule set.

  active:
    description:
      - Whether or not this rule set should be the active rule set. Only has an impact if I(state) is C(present).
      - If omitted, the active rule set will not be changed.
      - If C(True) then this rule set will be made active and all others inactive.
      - if C(False) then this rule set will be deactivated. Be careful with this as you can end up with no active rule set.

      - When deleting a rule set, deactivate it first (AWS prevents deletion of the active rule set).
