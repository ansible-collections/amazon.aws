# Amazon AWS Collection
The Ansible Amazon AWS collection includes a variety of Ansible content to help automate the management of AWS services. This collection is maintained by the Ansible cloud team.

## Description

The primary purpose of this collection is to simplify and streamline the management of AWS resources through automation. By leveraging this collection, organizations can reduce manual intervention, minimize errors, and ensure consistent and repeatable deployments. This leads to increased efficiency, faster deployments, and a more agile IT infrastructure.

AWS related modules and plugins supported by the Ansible community are in the [community.aws](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/) collection.

Being Red Hat Ansible Certified Content, this collection is eligible for support through the [Ansible Automation Platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible).

## Requirements

### Ansible version compatibility

Tested with the Ansible Core >= 2.15.0 versions, and the current development version of Ansible. Ansible Core versions prior to 2.15.0 are not supported.

### Python version compatibility

This collection depends on the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3 and Botocore).  Due to the
[AWS SDK Python Support Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/python-support-policy-updates-for-aws-sdks-and-tools/)
this collection requires Python 3.7 or greater.

Amazon has also announced the planned end of support for
[Python less than 3.8](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/python-support-policy-updates-for-aws-sdks-and-tools/).
As such support for Python less than 3.8 will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01.

<!---
### End of Support by Python Versions:

| Python Version | AWS SDK | Collection |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| 2.7 | July 2021 | Release 2.0.0 (September 2021) |
| 3.4 | February 2021 | Release 1.0.0 (June 2020) |

### AWS SDK version compatibility

Starting with the 2.0.0 releases of amazon.aws and community.aws, it is generally the collection's policy to support the versions of `botocore` and `boto3` that were released 12 months prior to the most recent major collection release, following semantic versioning (for example, 2.0.0, 3.0.0).

Version 9.0.0 of this collection supports `boto3 >= 1.28.0` and `botocore >= 1.31.0`

All support for the original AWS SDK `boto` was removed in release 4.0.0.

## Installation

The amazon.aws collection can be installed with Ansible Galaxy command-line tool:

```
    ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: amazon.aws
```

Note that if you install any collections from Ansible Galaxy, they will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade the Ansible package.
To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws --upgrade
```
A specific version of the collection can be installed by using the `version` keyword in the `requirements.yml` file:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: amazon.aws
    version: 3.1.1
```

or using the ansible-galaxy command as follows

```
ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws:==1.0.0
```

The python module dependencies are not installed by `ansible-galaxy`.  They can
be manually installed using pip:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

or:

    pip install boto3 botocore

Refer the following for more details.
* [Amazon Web Services Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/amazon/aws/docsite/guide_aws.html)
* [using Ansible collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.

## Use Cases

You can either call modules by their Fully Qualified Collection Name (FQCN), such as `amazon.aws.ec2_instance`, or you can call modules by their short name if you list the `amazon.aws` collection in the playbook's `collections` keyword:

```yaml
---
  - name: Setup an instance for testing
    amazon.aws.ec2_instance:
      name: '{{ ec2_instance_name }}'
      instance_type: t2.nano
      image_id: "{{ (amis.images | sort(attribute='creation_date') | last).image_id }}"
      wait: yes
      volumes:
        - device_name: /dev/xvda
          ebs:
            volume_size: 8
            delete_on_termination: true
    register: instance

  - name: Gather {{ ec2_instance_name }} info
    amazon.aws.ec2_instance_info:
      filters:
        tag:Name: "{{ ec2_instance_name }}"
        include_attributes:
          - instanceType
          - kernel
          - ramdisk
          - userData
          - disableApiTermination
          - instanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior
          - rootDeviceName
          - blockDeviceMapping
          - productCodes
          - sourceDestCheck
          - groupSet
          - ebsOptimized
          - sriovNetSupport
          - enclaveOptions
      register: instance_info

  - name: Delete instance created for tests
    amazon.aws.ec2_instance:
      state: absent
      instance_ids: "{{ instance.instance_ids }}"
      wait: false
```
