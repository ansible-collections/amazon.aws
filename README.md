# Amazon AWS Collection
The Ansible Amazon AWS collection includes a variety of Ansible content to help automate the management of AWS instances. This collection is maintained by the Ansible cloud team.

AWS related modules and plugins supported by the Ansible community are in the [community.aws](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/) collection.

<!--start requires_ansible-->
## Ansible version compatibility

This collection has been tested against following Ansible versions: **>=2.9.10**.

Plugins and modules within a collection may be tested with only specific Ansible versions.
A collection may contain metadata that identifies these versions.
PEP440 is the schema used to describe the versions of Ansible.
<!--end requires_ansible-->

## Python version compatibility

As the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3 and Botocore) has [ceased supporting Python 2.7](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-end-of-support-for-python-2-7-in-aws-sdk-for-python-and-aws-cli-v1/), this collection requires Python 3.6 or greater.

## AWS SDK version compatibility

Starting with the 2.0.0 releases of amazon.aws and community.aws, it is generally the collection's policy to support the versions of `botocore` and `boto3` that were released 12 months prior to the most recent major collection release, following semantic versioning (for example, 2.0.0, 3.0.0).

Version 3.0.0 of this collection supports `boto3 >= 1.16.0` and `botocore >= 1.19.0`

Support for the original AWS SDK `boto` has been deprecated and the module_utils library code to support it will be removed in release 4.0.0.

## Installing this collection

You can install the AWS collection with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

    ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: amazon.aws
```

The python module dependencies are not installed by `ansible-galaxy`.  They can
be manually installed using pip:

    pip install requirements.txt

or:

    pip install boto boto3 botocore

## Using this collection


You can either call modules by their Fully Qualified Collection Namespace (FQCN), such as `amazon.aws.ec2_instance`, or you can call modules by their short name if you list the `amazon.aws` collection in the playbook's `collections` keyword:

```yaml
---
  - name: Setup an instance for testing
    amazon.aws.ec2_instance:
      name: '{{ resource_prefix }}'
      instance_type: t2.nano
      image_id: "{{ (amis.images | sort(attribute='creation_date') | last).image_id }}"
      wait: yes
      volumes:
        - device_name: /dev/xvda
          ebs:
            volume_size: 8
            delete_on_termination: true
    register: instance
```
