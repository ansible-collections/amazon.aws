The Ansible Amazon AWS collection includes a variety of Ansible content to help automate the management of AWS instances. This collection is maintained by the Ansible cloud team.

## Included content

Click the ``Content`` button to see the list of content included in this collection.

## Installing this collection

You can install the AWS collection with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

    ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: amazon.aws
    version: 0.1.1
```
## Using this collection


You can either call modules by their Fully Qualified Collection Namespace (FQCN), such as `amazon.aws.ec2_instance`, or you can call modules by their short name if you list the `amazon.aws` collection in the playbook's `collections` keyword:

```yaml
---
  - name: Setup an instance for testing
    amazon.aws.ec2_instance:
      name: '{{ resource_prefix }}'
      instance_type: t2.nano
      image_id: "{{ (amis.images | sort(attribute='creation_date') | last).image_id }}"
      wait: yes
      volumes:
        - device_name: /dev/xvda
          ebs:
            volume_size: 8
            delete_on_termination: true
    register: instance
```
