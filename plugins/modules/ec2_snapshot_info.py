module: ec2_snapshot_info
version_added: 1.0.0
short_description: Gather information about ec2 volume snapshots in AWS
description:
    - Gather information about ec2 volume snapshots in AWS.
    - This module was called C(ec2_snapshot_facts) before Ansible 2.9. The usage did not change.
author:
    - "Rob White (@wimnat)"
    - Aubin Bikouo (@abikouo)
options:
  snapshot_ids:
    description:
      - If you specify one or more snapshot IDs, only snapshots that have the specified IDs are returned.
    required: false
    default: []
    type: list
    elements: str
  owner_ids:
    description:
      - If you specify one or more snapshot owners, only snapshots from the specified owners and for which you have
        access are returned.
    required: false
    default: []
    type: list
    elements: str
  restorable_by_user_ids:
    description:
      - If you specify a list of restorable users, only snapshots with create snapshot permissions for those users are
        returned.
    required: false
    default: []
    type: list
    elements: str
  filters:
    description:
      - A dict of filters to apply. Each dict item consists of a filter key and a filter value. See
        U(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeSnapshots.html) for possible filters. Filter
        names and values are case sensitive.
    required: false
    type: dict
    default: {}
  max_results:
    description:
    - The maximum number of snapshot results returned in paginated output.
    - When used only a single page along with a C(next_token_id) response element will be returned.
    - The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another request with the returned C(next_token_id) value.
    - This value can be between 5 and 1000; if I(next_token_id) is given a value larger than 1000, only 1000 results are returned.
    - If this parameter is not used, then DescribeSnapshots returns all results.
    - This parameter is mutually exclusive with I(snapshot_ids).
    required: False
    type: int
  next_token_id:
    description:
    - Contains the value returned from a previous paginated request where I(max_results) was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter.
    - Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the I(next_token_id) value.
    - This parameter is mutually exclusive with I(snapshot_ids)
    required: false
    type: str
notes:
  - By default, the module will return all snapshots, including public ones. To limit results to snapshots owned by
    the account use the filter 'owner-id'.
