module: aws_caller_info
version_added: 1.0.0
short_description: Get information about the user and account being used to make AWS calls.
description:
    - This module returns information about the account and user / role from which the AWS access tokens originate.
    - The primary use of this is to get the account id for templating into ARNs or similar to avoid needing to specify this information in inventory.
    - This module was called M(amazon.aws.aws_caller_facts) before Ansible 2.9. The usage did not change.
