bugfixes:
- revert breaking change introduced in 5.2.0 when passing credentials through a mix of environment variables and parameters (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/1353).
deprecated_features:
- support for passing both profile and security tokens through a mix of environment variables and parameters has been deprecated and support will be removed in release 6.0.0.
  After release 6.0.0 it will only be possible to pass either a profile or security tokens, regardless of mechanism used to pass them.  To explicitly block a parameter coming from an environment variable pass an empty string as the parameter value```
  Support for passing profile and security tokens together was originally deprecated in release 1.2.0, however only partially implemented in release 5.0.0
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1355).
