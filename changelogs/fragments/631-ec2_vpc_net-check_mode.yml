bugfixes:
- >-
  ec2_vpc_net - In check mode, ensure the module does not change the configuration.
  Handle case when Amazon-provided ipv6 block is enabled, then disabled, then enabled again.
  Do not disable IPv6 CIDR association (using Amazon pool) if ipv6_cidr property is not present in the task.
  If the VPC already exists and ipv6_cidr property, retain the current config (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/631).
