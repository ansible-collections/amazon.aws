bugfixes:
- ec2_vpc_nat_gateway - fixes to nat gateway so that when the user creates a private NAT gateway, an Elastic IP address should not be allocated. The module had inncorrectly always allocate elastic IP address when creating private nat gateway (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1632).
