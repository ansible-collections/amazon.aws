breaking_changes:
  - ec2_vpc_dhcp_option_info - Now preserves case for tag keys in return value. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/252)
  - ec2_vpc_dhcp_option - The module has been refactored to use boto3. Keys and value types returned by the module are now consistent, which is a change from the previous behaviour. A ``purge_tags`` option has been added, which defaults to ``True``.  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/252)
minor_changes:
  - ec2_vpc_dhcp_option - Now also returns a boto3-style resource description in the ``dhcp_options`` result key.  This includes any tags for the ``dhcp_options_id`` and has the same format as the current return value of ``ec2_vpc_dhcp_option_info``. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/252)
  - ec2_vpc_dhcp_option_info - Now also returns a user-friendly ``dhcp_config`` key that matches the historical ``new_config`` key from ec2_vpc_dhcp_option, and alleviates the need to use ``items2dict(key_name='key', value_name='values')`` when parsing the output of the module. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/252)
deprecated_features:
  - ec2_vpc_dhcp_option - The ``new_config`` return key has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  It will be replaced by ``dhcp_config``.  Both values are returned in the interim. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/252)
