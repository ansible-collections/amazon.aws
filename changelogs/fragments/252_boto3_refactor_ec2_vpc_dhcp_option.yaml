breaking_changes:
  - ec2_vpc_dhcp_option_info - Now preserves case for tag keys in return value. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/252)
  - ec2_vpc_dhcp_option - The module has been refactored to use boto3. Keys and value types returned by the module are now consistent, which is a change from the previous behaviour. A ``purge_tags`` option has been added, which defaults to ``True``.  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/252)
