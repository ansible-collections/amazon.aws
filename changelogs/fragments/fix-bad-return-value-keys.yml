  - route53 - the ``values`` key in the ``resource_record_sets`` return value has been deprecated
    in favor of ``record_values`` for Jinja2 compatibility. The ``values`` key will be removed in
    a release after 2026-12-01 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2772).

minor_changes:
  - route53 - added ``record_values`` key to ``resource_record_sets`` return value that can be
    accessed using Jinja2 dot notation (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2772).

bugfixes:
  - lambda_info - fixed invalid return value documentation that used dot notation
    (``function.TheName``) which cannot be used in Jinja2 templates
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2772).
