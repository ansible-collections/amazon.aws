bugfixes:
- ec2_vpc_nat_gateway - adding a boolean parameter called ``default_create`` to allow users to have the option to choose whether they want to display an error message or create a NAT gateway when an EIP address is not found. The module (ec2_vpc_nat_gateway) had incorrectly failed silently if EIP didn't exist (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/1295).
