- amazon.aws collection - due to the AWS SDKs announcing the end of support
  for Python less than 3.7 (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/python-support-policy-updates-for-aws-sdks-and-tools/)
  support for Python less than 3.7 by this collection wss been deprecated in release 6.0.0 and removed in release 7.0.0.
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1763).

# We've already announced the deprecation for <3.8 (with 6.0.0), dropping support for <3.9 on ours side will happen
# after April 2026.  This is about 2 years + 5 months away assuming a November 7.0.0 release, we could announce
# the deprecation now, but assuming we release 8.0.0 in about 6 months a just short of 2 year
# deprecation feels fine given it's predictable.
