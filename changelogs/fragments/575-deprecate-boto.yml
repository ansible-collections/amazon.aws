deprecated_features:
- module_utils - support for the original AWS SDK `boto` has been deprecated in favour of the `boto3`/`botocore` SDK.
  All `boto` based modules have either been deprecated or migrated to `botocore`, and the remaining support code in module_utils will be removed in release 4.0.0 of the amazon.aws collection.
  Any modules outside of the amazon.aws and community.aws collections based on the `boto` library will need to be migrated to the `boto3`/`botocore` libraries
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/575).
