breaking_changes:
  - aws_s3 - can now delete versioned buckets even when they are not empty - set mode to delete to delete a versioned bucket and everything in it.
major_changes:
  - "ec2 module_utils: The ``AWSRetry`` decorator no longer catches ``NotFound`` exceptions by default.  ``NotFound`` exceptions need to be explicitly added using ``catch_extra_error_codes``.  Some AWS modules may see an increase in transient failures due to AWS's eventual consistency model."
deprecated_features:
  - cloudformation - the ``template_format`` option has been deprecated and will be removed in a later release. It has been ignored by the module since Ansible 2.3.
  - ec2_key - the ``wait`` option has been deprecated and will be removed in a later release. It has had no effect since Ansible 2.5.
  - ec2_key - the ``wait_timeout`` option has been deprecated and will be removed in a later release. It has had no effect since Ansible 2.5.
  - ec2_tag - support for ``list`` as a state has been deprecated and will be removed in a later release.  The ``ec2_tag_info`` can be used to fetch the tags on an EC2 resource.
  - ec2 - in a later release, the ``group`` and ``group_id`` options will become mutually exclusive.  Currently ``group_id`` is ignored if you pass both.
