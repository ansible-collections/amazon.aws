breaking_changes:
  - module_utils.ec2 - dropped deprecated ``boto3`` parameter from ``get_ec2_security_group_ids_from_names()`` and ``get_aws_connection_info()``; it has had no effect since release 4.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2610).

minor_changes:
  - module_utils/modules.py - calling ``deprecate()`` without ``collection_name``, ``version``, or ``date`` now raises a sanity error (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2610).
