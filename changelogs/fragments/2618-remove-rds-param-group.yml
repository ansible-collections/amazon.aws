breaking_changes:
  - rds_param_group - the redirect has been removed and playbooks should be updated to use rds_instance_param_group (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2618).
  - ec2_vpc_peering_info - the `result` key has been removed from the return value. `vpc_peering_connections` should be used instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2618).
