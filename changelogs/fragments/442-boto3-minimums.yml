major_changes:
- amazon.aws collection - The amazon.aws collection has dropped support for ``botocore<1.16.0`` and ``boto3<1.13.0``.
  Most modules will continue to work with older versions of the AWS SDK, however compatability with older versions of the SDK is not guaranteed and will not be tested.
  When using older versions of the SDK a warning will be emitted by Ansible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/442).
