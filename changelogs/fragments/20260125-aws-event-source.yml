minor_changes:
  - aws event source - copy aws_cloudtrail and aws_sqs_queue event source plugins, with a proper git history, from ansible.eda to amazon.aws collection (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2816).
trivial:
  - aws event source - add unit tests for aws_cloudtrail and aws_sqs_queue event source plugins (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2816).
  - aws event source - integration test for aws_cloudtrail event source plugin is temporary disabled, as it is not tested and CI environment is not yet configured to run them (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2816).
