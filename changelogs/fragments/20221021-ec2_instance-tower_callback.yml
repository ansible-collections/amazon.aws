minor_changes:
- ec2_instance - refacter ``tower_callback`` code to handle parameter validation as part of the argument specification (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1199).
- ec2_instance - the ``tower_callback`` parameter has been renamed to ``aap_callback``, ``tower_callback`` remains as an alias.  This change should have no observable effect for users outside the module documentation (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1199).
security_fixes:
- ec2_instance - fixes leak of password into logs when using ``tower_callback.windows=True`` and ``tower_callback.set_password`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1199).
