removed_features:
- ec2_vpc_endpoint_info - support for the ``query`` parameter was removed.
  The ``amazon.aws.ec2_vpc_endpoint_info`` module now only queries for endpoints.
  Services can be queried using the ``amazon.aws.ec2_vpc_endpoint_service_info`` module
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1308).
