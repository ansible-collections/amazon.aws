breaking_changes:
- >-
  ec2_instance - instance wait for state behaviour has changed.  If plays
  require the old behavior of waiting for the instance monitoring status to
  become ``OK`` when launching a new instance, the action will need to specify
  ``state: started``
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/481).
bugfixes:
- >-
  ec2_instance - ``ec2_instance`` was waiting on EC2 instance monitoring status
  to be ``OK`` when launching a new instance. This could cause a play to wait
  multiple minutes for AWS's monitoring to complete status checks
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/481).
