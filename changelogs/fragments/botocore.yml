breaking_changes:
- The amazon.aws collection has dropped support for ``botocore<1.29.0`` and
  ``boto3<1.26.0``. Most modules will continue to work with older versions of the AWS SDK, however
  compatability with older versions of the SDK is not guaranteed and will not be tested. When using
  older versions of the SDK a warning will be emitted by Ansible
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1763).
