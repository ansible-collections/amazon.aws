major_changes:
  - amazon.aws collection - The amazon.aws collection has dropped support for
    ``botocore<1.34.0`` and ``boto3<1.34.0``. Most modules will continue to work
    with older versions of the AWS SDK, however compatibility with older versions
    of the SDK is not guaranteed and will not be tested. When using older versions
    of the SDK a warning will be emitted by Ansible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2426).
  - amazon.aws collection - due to the AWS SDKs announcing the end of support for Python less than 3.8
    (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/python-support-policy-updates-for-aws-sdks-and-tools/) support for Python
    less than 3.8 by this collection was deprecated in release 6.0.0 and removed in release 10.0.0.
