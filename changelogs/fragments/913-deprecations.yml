breaking_changes:
- ec2_ami - the parameter aliases ``DeviceName``, ``VirtualName`` and ``NoDevice`` were previously deprecated and have been removed, please use ``device_name``, ``virtual_name`` and ``no_device`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/913).
- ec2_vpc_dhcp_option_info - the parameter aliases ``DhcpOptionIds`` and ``DryRun`` were previously deprecated and have been removed, please use ``dhcp_options_ids`` and ``no_device`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/913).
