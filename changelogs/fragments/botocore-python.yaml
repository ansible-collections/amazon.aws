breaking_changes:
  - The amazon.aws collection has dropped support for ``botocore<1.31.0`` and
    ``boto3<1.28.0``. Most modules will continue to work with older versions of
    the AWS SDK.  However, compatability with older versions of the SDK is not guaranteed
    and will not be tested. When using older versions of the SDK a warning will
    be emitted by Ansible
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2161).
deprecated_features:
  - amazon.aws collection - due to the AWS SDKs announcing the end of support
    for Python less than 3.8 (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/python-support-policy-updates-for-aws-sdks-and-tools/)
    support for Python less than 3.8 by this collection has been deprecated
    and will removed in release 10.0.0
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2161).
