bugfixes:
  - s3_object - when doing a put and specifying ``Content-Type`` in metadata, this module (since 6.0.0) erroneously set the ``Content-Type`` to ``None`` causing the
    put to fail. Fix now correctly honours the specified ``Content-Type`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/1881).
