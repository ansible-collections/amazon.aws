major_changes:
- amazon.aws collection - Due to the AWS SDKs announcing the end of support for Python less than 3.6 (https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/1.17.64/guide/migrationpy3.html) this collection now requires Python 3.6+ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/298).
