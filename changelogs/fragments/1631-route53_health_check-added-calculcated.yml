minor_changes:
  - route53_health_check - adding another type choice called "CALCULATED", added a string list parameter called child_health_checks to specify health checks that must be healthy for this calculated health check to be considered healthy, and added an integer paramter called health_threshold to specify the minimum number of healthy child health checks that must be healthy for the calculated health check to be considered healthy. The module (route53_health_check) had not supported calculated health check (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1631).
