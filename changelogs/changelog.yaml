        after 2022-06-01

        tags on an EC2 resource.
      major_changes:
      - ec2 module_utils - The ``AWSRetry`` decorator no longer catches ``NotFound``
        exceptions by default.  ``NotFound`` exceptions need to be explicitly added
        using ``catch_extra_error_codes``.  Some AWS modules may see an increase in
        transient failures due to AWS''s eventual consistency model.
      minor_changes:
      - Add `aws_security_token`, `aws_endpoint_url` and `endpoint_url` aliases to
        improve AWS module parameter naming consistency.
      - Add support for `aws_ca_bundle` to boto3 based AWS modules
      - Add support for configuring boto3 profiles using `AWS_PROFILE` and `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE`
      - Added check_mode support to aws_az_info
      - Added check_mode support to ec2_eni_info
      - Added check_mode support to ec2_snapshot_info
      - ansible_dict_to_boto3_filter_list - convert integers and bools to strings
        before using them in filters.
      - aws_direct_connect_virtual_interface - add direct_connect_gateway_id parameter.
        This field is only applicable in private VIF cases (public=False) and is mutually
        exclusive to virtual_gateway_id.
      - cloudformation - Return change_set_id in the cloudformation output if a change
        set was created.
      - ec2 - deprecate allowing both group and group_id - currently we ignore group_id
        if both are passed.
      - ec2_ami_info - allow integer and bool values for filtering images (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/43570).
      - ec2_asg - Add support for Max Instance Lifetime
      - ec2_asg - Add the ability to use mixed_instance_policy in launch template
        driven autoscaling groups
      - ec2_asg - Migrated to AnsibleAWSModule

  1.2.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - ec2 module_utils - Ensure boto3 verify parameter isn't overridden by setting
        a profile (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/129)
      - 's3_bucket - Ceph compatibility: treat error code NoSuchTagSetError used by
        Ceph synonymously to NoSuchTagSet used by AWS'
      deprecated_features:
      - All AWS Modules - ``aws_access_key``, ``aws_secret_key`` and ``security_token``
        will be made mutually exclusive with ``profile`` after 2022-06-01.
      minor_changes:
      - ec2 module_utils - Update ``ec2_connect`` (boto2) behaviour so that ``ec2_url``
        overrides ``region``.
      - module_utils.core - Support passing arbitrary extra keys to fail_json_aws,
        matching capabilities of fail_json.
