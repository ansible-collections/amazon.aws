      deprecated_features:
      - cloudformation - The ``template_format`` option had no effect since Ansible
        2.3 and will be removed after 2022-06-01
      - cloudformation - the ``template_format`` option has been deprecated and will
        be removed in a later release. It has been ignored by the module since Ansible
        2.3.
      - data_pipeline - The ``version`` option had no effect and will be removed in
        after 2022-06-01
      - ec2 - in a later release, the ``group`` and ``group_id`` options will become
        mutually exclusive.  Currently ``group_id`` is ignored if you pass both.
      - ec2_ami - The ``no_device`` alias ``NoDevice`` has been deprecated  and will
        be removed after 2022-06-01

        tags on an EC2 resource.
      major_changes:
      - ec2 module_utils - The ``AWSRetry`` decorator no longer catches ``NotFound``
        exceptions by default.  ``NotFound`` exceptions need to be explicitly added
        using ``catch_extra_error_codes``.  Some AWS modules may see an increase in
        transient failures due to AWS''s eventual consistency model.
      minor_changes:

        before using them in filters.
      - aws_direct_connect_virtual_interface - add direct_connect_gateway_id parameter.
        This field is only applicable in private VIF cases (public=False) and is mutually
        exclusive to virtual_gateway_id.
      - cloudformation - Return change_set_id in the cloudformation output if a change
        set was created.
      - ec2 - deprecate allowing both group and group_id - currently we ignore group_id
        if both are passed.

        a profile (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/129)
      - 's3_bucket - Ceph compatibility: treat error code NoSuchTagSetError used by
        Ceph synonymously to NoSuchTagSet used by AWS'
      deprecated_features:
      - All AWS Modules - ``aws_access_key``, ``aws_secret_key`` and ``security_token``
        will be made mutually exclusive with ``profile`` after 2022-06-01.
      minor_changes:
      - ec2 module_utils - Update ``ec2_connect`` (boto2) behaviour so that ``ec2_url``
        overrides ``region``.
      - module_utils.core - Support passing arbitrary extra keys to fail_json_aws,
        matching capabilities of fail_json.

  1.4.1:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - module_utils - the ipaddress module utility has been vendored into this collection.  This
        eliminates the collection dependency on ansible.netcommon (which had removed

  2.0.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - 'ec2_instance - instance wait for state behaviour has changed.  If plays require
        the old behavior of waiting for the instance monitoring status to become ``OK``
        when launching a new instance, the action will need to specify ``state: started``
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/481).'
      - ec2_snapshot - support for waiting indefinitely has been dropped, new default
        is 10 minutes (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/356).
      - ec2_vol_info - return ``attachment_set`` is now a list of attachments with
        Multi-Attach support on disk. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/362).
      - ec2_vpc_dhcp_option - The module has been refactored to use boto3. Keys and
        value types returned by the module are now consistent, which is a change from
        the previous behaviour. A ``purge_tags`` option has been added, which defaults
        to ``True``.  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/252)
      - ec2_vpc_dhcp_option_info - Now preserves case for tag keys in return value.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/252)
      - module_utils.core - The boto3 switch has been removed from the region parameter
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/287).
      - module_utils/compat - vendored copy of ipaddress removed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/461).
      - module_utils/core - updated the ``scrub_none_parameters`` function so that
        ``descend_into_lists`` is set to ``True`` by default (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/297).
      bugfixes:
      - aws_s3 - Fix upload permission when an S3 bucket ACL policy requires a particular
        canned ACL (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/318)
      - ec2_ami - Fix ami issue when creating an ami with no_device parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/386)
      - ec2_instance - ``ec2_instance`` was waiting on EC2 instance monitoring status
        to be ``OK`` when launching a new instance. This could cause a play to wait
        multiple minutes for AWS's monitoring to complete status checks (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/481).
      - ec2_snapshot - Fix snapshot issue when capturing a snapshot of a volume without
        tags (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/383)
      - ec2_vol - Fixes ``changed`` status when ``modify_volume`` is used, but no
        new  disk is being attached.  The module incorrectly reported that no change
        had  occurred even when disks had been modified (iops, throughput, type, etc.).
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/482).
      - ec2_vol - fix iops setting and enforce iops/throughput parameters usage (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/334)
      - inventory - ``include_filters`` won't be ignored anymore if ``filters`` is
        not set (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/457).
      - s3_bucket - Fix error handling when attempting to set a feature that is not
        implemented (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/391).
      - s3_bucket - Gracefully handle ``NotImplemented`` exceptions when fetching
        encryption settings (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/390).
      deprecated_features:
      - ec2 - the boto based ``ec2`` module has been deprecated in favour of the boto3
        based ``ec2_instance`` module. The ``ec2`` module will be removed in release
        4.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/424).
      - ec2_vpc_dhcp_option - The ``new_config`` return key has been deprecated and
        will be removed in a future release.  It will be replaced by ``dhcp_config``.  Both
        values are returned in the interim. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/252)
      major_changes:
      - amazon.aws collection - Due to the AWS SDKs announcing the end of support
        for Python less than 3.6 (https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/1.17.64/guide/migrationpy3.html)
        this collection now requires Python 3.6+ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/298).
      - amazon.aws collection - The amazon.aws collection has dropped support for
        ``botocore<1.18.0`` and ``boto3<1.15.0``. Most modules will continue to work
        with older versions of the AWS SDK, however compatability with older versions
        of the SDK is not guaranteed and will not be tested. When using older versions
        of the SDK a warning will be emitted by Ansible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/502).
      - ec2_instance - The module has been migrated from the ``community.aws`` collection.

      deprecated_features:
      - module_utils - support for the original AWS SDK `boto` has been deprecated
        in favour of the `boto3`/`botocore` SDK. All `boto` based modules have either
        been deprecated or migrated to `botocore`, and the remaining support code
        in module_utils will be removed in release 4.0.0 of the amazon.aws collection.
        Any modules outside of the amazon.aws and community.aws collections based
        on the `boto` library will need to be migrated to the `boto3`/`botocore` libraries
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/575).
      major_changes:
      - amazon.aws collection - The amazon.aws collection has dropped support for
        ``botocore<1.19.0`` and ``boto3<1.16.0``. Most modules will continue to work
        with older versions of the AWS SDK, however compatability with older versions
        of the SDK is not guaranteed and will not be tested. When using older versions
        of the SDK a warning will be emitted by Ansible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/574).
      minor_changes:
      - ec2_instance - add count parameter support (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/539).
