        2.3 and will be removed after 2022-06-01
      - cloudformation - the ``template_format`` option has been deprecated and will
        be removed in a later release. It has been ignored by the module since Ansible
        2.3.
      - data_pipeline - The ``version`` option had no effect and will be removed in
        after 2022-06-01
      - ec2 - in a later release, the ``group`` and ``group_id`` options will become
        mutually exclusive.  Currently ``group_id`` is ignored if you pass both.
      - ec2_ami - The ``no_device`` alias ``NoDevice`` has been deprecated  and will
        be removed after 2022-06-01

        tags on an EC2 resource.
      major_changes:
      - ec2 module_utils - The ``AWSRetry`` decorator no longer catches ``NotFound``
        exceptions by default.  ``NotFound`` exceptions need to be explicitly added
        using ``catch_extra_error_codes``.  Some AWS modules may see an increase in
        transient failures due to AWS''s eventual consistency model.
      minor_changes:

        before using them in filters.
      - aws_direct_connect_virtual_interface - add direct_connect_gateway_id parameter.
        This field is only applicable in private VIF cases (public=False) and is mutually
        exclusive to virtual_gateway_id.
      - cloudformation - Return change_set_id in the cloudformation output if a change
        set was created.
      - ec2 - deprecate allowing both group and group_id - currently we ignore group_id
        if both are passed.

      - 's3_bucket - Ceph compatibility: treat error code NoSuchTagSetError used by
        Ceph synonymously to NoSuchTagSet used by AWS'
      deprecated_features:
      - All AWS Modules - ``aws_access_key``, ``aws_secret_key`` and ``security_token``
        will be made mutually exclusive with ``profile`` after 2022-06-01.
      minor_changes:
      - ec2 module_utils - Update ``ec2_connect`` (boto2) behaviour so that ``ec2_url``

  2.0.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - 'ec2_instance - instance wait for state behaviour has changed.  If plays require
        the old behavior of waiting for the instance monitoring status to become ``OK``
        when launching a new instance, the action will need to specify ``state: started``
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/481).'
      - ec2_snapshot - support for waiting indefinitely has been dropped, new default
        is 10 minutes (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/356).
      - ec2_vol_info - return ``attachment_set`` is now a list of attachments with
        Multi-Attach support on disk. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/362).
      - ec2_vpc_dhcp_option - The module has been refactored to use boto3. Keys and
        value types returned by the module are now consistent, which is a change from
        the previous behaviour. A ``purge_tags`` option has been added, which defaults
        to ``True``.  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/252)
      - ec2_vpc_dhcp_option_info - Now preserves case for tag keys in return value.

      - aws_s3 - Fix upload permission when an S3 bucket ACL policy requires a particular
        canned ACL (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/318)
      - ec2_ami - Fix ami issue when creating an ami with no_device parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/386)
      - ec2_instance - ``ec2_instance`` was waiting on EC2 instance monitoring status
        to be ``OK`` when launching a new instance. This could cause a play to wait
        multiple minutes for AWS's monitoring to complete status checks (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/481).
      - ec2_snapshot - Fix snapshot issue when capturing a snapshot of a volume without
        tags (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/383)
      - ec2_vol - Fixes ``changed`` status when ``modify_volume`` is used, but no
        new  disk is being attached.  The module incorrectly reported that no change
        had  occurred even when disks had been modified (iops, throughput, type, etc.).
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/482).
      - ec2_vol - fix iops setting and enforce iops/throughput parameters usage (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/334)
      - inventory - ``include_filters`` won't be ignored anymore if ``filters`` is
        not set (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/457).
      - s3_bucket - Fix error handling when attempting to set a feature that is not
        implemented (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/391).
      - s3_bucket - Gracefully handle ``NotImplemented`` exceptions when fetching
        encryption settings (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/390).
      deprecated_features:
      - ec2 - the boto based ``ec2`` module has been deprecated in favour of the boto3
        based ``ec2_instance`` module. The ``ec2`` module will be removed in release
        4.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/424).
      - ec2_vpc_dhcp_option - The ``new_config`` return key has been deprecated and
        will be removed in a future release.  It will be replaced by ``dhcp_config``.  Both
        values are returned in the interim. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/252)
      major_changes:
      - amazon.aws collection - Due to the AWS SDKs announcing the end of support
        for Python less than 3.6 (https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/1.17.64/guide/migrationpy3.html)
        this collection now requires Python 3.6+ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/298).
      - amazon.aws collection - The amazon.aws collection has dropped support for
        ``botocore<1.18.0`` and ``boto3<1.15.0``. Most modules will continue to work
        with older versions of the AWS SDK, however compatibility with older versions
        of the SDK is not guaranteed and will not be tested. When using older versions
        of the SDK a warning will be emitted by Ansible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/502).
      - ec2_instance - The module has been migrated from the ``community.aws`` collection.

    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - aws_ec2 inventory - use the iam_role_arn configuration parameter to assume
        the role before trying to call DescribeRegions if the regions configuration
        is not set and AWS credentials provided without enough privilege to perform
        the DescribeRegions action. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/566).
      - ec2_vol - Sets the Iops value in req_obj even if the iops value has not changed,
        to allow modifying volume types that require passing an iops value to boto.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/606)
      - ec2_vol - changing a volume from a type that does not support IOPS (like ``standard``)
        to a type that does (like ``gp3``) fails (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/626).

      deprecated_features:
      - module_utils - support for the original AWS SDK ``boto`` has been deprecated
        in favour of the ``boto3``/``botocore`` SDK. All ``boto`` based modules have
        either been deprecated or migrated to ``botocore``, and the remaining support
        code in module_utils will be removed in release 4.0.0 of the amazon.aws collection.
        Any modules outside of the amazon.aws and community.aws collections based
        on the ``boto`` library will need to be migrated to the ``boto3``/``botocore``
        libraries (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/575).
      major_changes:
      - amazon.aws collection - The amazon.aws collection has dropped support for
        ``botocore<1.19.0`` and ``boto3<1.16.0``. Most modules will continue to work
        with older versions of the AWS SDK, however compatibility with older versions
        of the SDK is not guaranteed and will not be tested. When using older versions
        of the SDK a warning will be emitted by Ansible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/574).
      minor_changes:
      - ec2_instance - add count parameter support (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/539).

      - Various modules and plugins - use vendored version of ``distutils.version``
        instead of the deprecated Python standard library ``distutils`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/599).
      - aws_acm - No longer raising ResourceNotFound exception while retrieving ACM
        certificates.
      - aws_s3 - fix exception raised when using module to copy from source to destination
        and key is missing from source (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/602).

        in the future release you must set an instance_type or a launch_template (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/587).
      minor_changes:
      - add new parameters hostvars_prefix and hostvars_suffix for inventory plugins
        aws_ec2 and aws_rds (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/535).

        is not set and AWS credentials provided without enough privilege to perform
        the DescribeRegions action. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/566).
      - ec2_vol - changing a volume from a type that does not support IOPS (like ``standard``)

        Handle case when Amazon-provided ipv6 block is enabled, then disabled, then
        enabled again. Do not disable IPv6 CIDR association (using Amazon pool) if
        ipv6_cidr property is not present in the task. If the VPC already exists and
        ipv6_cidr property, retain the current config (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/631).

  4.0.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - Tags beginning with ``aws:`` will not be removed when purging tags, these
        tags are reserved by Amazon and may not be updated or deleted (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/817).
      - amazon.aws collection - the ``profile`` parameter is now mutually exclusive
        with the ``aws_access_key``, ``aws_secret_key`` and ``security_token`` parameters
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/834).
      - aws_az_info - the module alias ``aws_az_facts`` was deprecated in Ansible
        2.9 and has now been removed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/832).
      - aws_s3 - the default value for ``ensure overwrite`` has been changed to ``different``
        instead of ``always`` so that the module is idempotent by default (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/811).
      - aws_ssm - on_denied and on_missing now both default to error, for consistency
        with both aws_secret and the base Lookup class (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/617).
      - ec2 - The ``ec2`` module has been removed in release 4.0.0 and replaced by
        the ``ec2_instance`` module (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/630).
      - ec2_vpc_igw_info - The default value for ``convert_tags`` has been changed

        including all relevant helper functions. All modules should now use the ``boto3``/``botocore``
        AWS SDK (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/630)
      bugfixes:
      - ec2_group - fix uncaught exception when running with ``--diff`` and ``--check``
        to create a new security group (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/440).
      - ec2_instance - Add a condition to handle default ```instance_type``` value
        for fix breaking on instance creation with launch template (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/587).
      - ec2_instance - raise an error when missing permission to stop instance when
        ``state`` is set to ``rebooted``` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/671).

      release_summary: In this release we promoted many community modules to Red Hat
        supported status. Those modules have been moved from the commuity.aws to amazon.aws
        collection. This release also brings some new features, bugfixes, breaking
        changes and deprecated features. The amazon.aws collection has dropped support
        for ``botocore<1.21.0`` and ``boto3<1.18.0``. Support for ``ansible-core<2.11``
        has also been dropped.

  6.2.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - backup_plan - Use existing ``scrub_none_values`` function from module_utils
        to remove None values from nested dicts in supplied params. Nested None values
        were being retained and causing an error when sent through to the boto3 client
        operation (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1611).
      - backup_vault - fix error when updating tags on a backup vault by using the
        correct boto3 client methods for tagging and untagging backup resources (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1610).
      - cloudwatchevent_rule - Fixes changed status to report False when no change
        has been made. The module had incorrectly always reported a change. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1589)
      - ec2_vpc_nat_gateway - adding a boolean parameter called ``default_create``
        to allow users to have the option to choose whether they want to display an
        error message or create a NAT gateway when an EIP address is not found. The
        module (ec2_vpc_nat_gateway) had incorrectly failed silently if EIP didn't
        exist (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/1295).
      - ec2_vpc_nat_gateway - fixes to nat gateway so that when the user creates a
        private NAT gateway, an Elastic IP address should not be allocated. The module
        had inncorrectly always allocate elastic IP address when creating private
        nat gateway (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1632).
      - lambda_execute - Fixes to the stack trace output, where it does not contain
        spaces between each character. The module had incorrectly always outputted
        extra spaces between each character. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1615)
      - module_utils.backup - get_selection_details fix empty list returned when multiple
        backup selections exist (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1633).
      minor_changes:
      - backup_selection - add validation and documentation for all conditions suboptions
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1633).
      - ec2_instance - refactored ARN validation handling (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1619).
      - iam_user - refactored ARN validation handling (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1619).
      - module_utils.arn - add ``resource_id`` and ``resource_type`` to ``parse_aws_arn``
        return values (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1619).
      - module_utils.arn - added ``validate_aws_arn`` function to handle common pattern
        matching for ARNs (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1619).

      - rds_cluster - Add ``AllocatedStorage``, ``DBClusterInstanceClass``, ``StorageType``,
        ``Iops``, and ``EngineMode`` to the list of parameters that can be passed
        when creating or modifying a Multi-AZ RDS cluster (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1657).
      - rds_cluster - Allow to pass GlobalClusterIdentifier to rds cluster on creation

        This starts the rds cluster (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1647/files).
      - rds_cluster - add support for another ``state`` choice called ``stopped``.
        This stops the rds cluster (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1647/files).
      - route53 - add a ``wait_id`` return value when a change is done (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1683).
      - route53_health_check - add support for a string list parameter called ``child_health_checks``
        to specify health checks that must be healthy for the calculated health check
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1631).
      - route53_health_check - add support for an integer parameter called ``health_threshold``
        to specify the minimum number of healthy child health checks that must be
        healthy for the calculated health check (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1631).
      - route53_health_check - add support for another ``type`` choice called ``CALCULATED``
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1631).

  6.4.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
