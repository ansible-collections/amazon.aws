Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- ec2_instance - instance wait for state behaviour has changed.  If plays require the old behavior of waiting for the instance monitoring status to become ``OK`` when launching a new instance, the action will need to specify ``state: started`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/481).
- ec2_snapshot - support for waiting indefinitely has been dropped, new default is 10 minutes (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/356).
- ec2_vol_info - return ``attachment_set`` is now a list of attachments with Multi-Attach support on disk. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/362).
- ec2_vpc_dhcp_option - The module has been refactored to use boto3. Keys and value types returned by the module are now consistent, which is a change from the previous behaviour. A ``purge_tags`` option has been added, which defaults to ``True``.  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/252)
- ec2_vpc_dhcp_option_info - Now preserves case for tag keys in return value. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/252)
- module_utils.core - The boto3 switch has been removed from the region parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/287).
- module_utils/compat - vendored copy of ipaddress removed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/461).
- module_utils/core - updated the ``scrub_none_parameters`` function so that ``descend_into_lists`` is set to ``True`` by default (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/297).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- ec2 - the boto based ``ec2`` module has been deprecated in favour of the boto3 based ``ec2_instance`` module. The ``ec2`` module will be removed in release 4.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/424).
- ec2_vpc_dhcp_option - The ``new_config`` return key has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  It will be replaced by ``dhcp_config``.  Both values are returned in the interim. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/252)

Bugfixes
--------

- aws_s3 - Fix upload permission when an S3 bucket ACL policy requires a particular canned ACL (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/318)
- ec2_ami - Fix ami issue when creating an ami with no_device parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/386)
- ec2_instance - ``ec2_instance`` was waiting on EC2 instance monitoring status to be ``OK`` when launching a new instance. This could cause a play to wait multiple minutes for AWS's monitoring to complete status checks (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/481).
- ec2_snapshot - Fix snapshot issue when capturing a snapshot of a volume without tags (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/383)
- ec2_vol - Fixes ``changed`` status when ``modify_volume`` is used, but no new  disk is being attached.  The module incorrectly reported that no change had  occurred even when disks had been modified (iops, throughput, type, etc.). (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/482).
- ec2_vol - fix iops setting and enforce iops/throughput parameters usage (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/334)
- inventory - ``include_filters`` won't be ignored anymore if ``filters`` is not set (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/457).
- s3_bucket - Fix error handling when attempting to set a feature that is not implemented (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/391).
- s3_bucket - Gracefully handle ``NotImplemented`` exceptions when fetching encryption settings (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/390).

--------

- ec2 module_utils - Ensure boto3 verify parameter isn't overridden by setting a profile (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/129)
- s3_bucket - Ceph compatibility: treat error code NoSuchTagSetError used by Ceph synonymously to NoSuchTagSet used by AWS

v1.1.0
======

Major Changes
-------------

- ec2 module_utils - The ``AWSRetry`` decorator no longer catches ``NotFound`` exceptions by default.  ``NotFound`` exceptions need to be explicitly added using ``catch_extra_error_codes``.  Some AWS modules may see an increase in transient failures due to AWS''s eventual consistency model.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Add `aws_security_token`, `aws_endpoint_url` and `endpoint_url` aliases to improve AWS module parameter naming consistency.
- Add support for `aws_ca_bundle` to boto3 based AWS modules
- Add support for configuring boto3 profiles using `AWS_PROFILE` and `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE`
- Added check_mode support to aws_az_info
- Added check_mode support to ec2_eni_info
- Added check_mode support to ec2_snapshot_info
- ansible_dict_to_boto3_filter_list - convert integers and bools to strings before using them in filters.
- aws_direct_connect_virtual_interface - add direct_connect_gateway_id parameter. This field is only applicable in private VIF cases (public=False) and is mutually exclusive to virtual_gateway_id.
- cloudformation - Return change_set_id in the cloudformation output if a change set was created.
- ec2 - deprecate allowing both group and group_id - currently we ignore group_id if both are passed.
- ec2_ami_info - allow integer and bool values for filtering images (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/43570).
- ec2_asg - Add support for Max Instance Lifetime
- ec2_asg - Add the ability to use mixed_instance_policy in launch template driven autoscaling groups
- ec2_asg - Migrated to AnsibleAWSModule
- ec2_placement_group - make `name` a required field.
- ec2_vol_info - Code cleanup and use of the AWSRetry decorator to improve stability
- ec2_vpc_net - Enable IPv6 CIDR assignment
