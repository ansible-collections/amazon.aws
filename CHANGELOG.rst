v1.2.0
======

Minor Changes
-------------

- ec2 module_utils - Update ``ec2_connect`` (boto2) behaviour so that ``ec2_url`` overrides ``region``.
- module_utils.core - Support passing arbitrary extra keys to fail_json_aws, matching capabilities of fail_json.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- All AWS Modules - ``aws_access_key``, ``aws_secret_key`` and ``security_token`` will be made mutually exclusive with ``profile`` after 2022-06-01.

Bugfixes
--------

- ec2 module_utils - Ensure boto3 verify parameter isn't overridden by setting a profile (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/129)
- s3_bucket - Ceph compatibility: treat error code NoSuchTagSetError used by Ceph synonymously to NoSuchTagSet used by AWS

v1.1.0
======

Major Changes
-------------

- ec2 module_utils - The ``AWSRetry`` decorator no longer catches ``NotFound`` exceptions by default.  ``NotFound`` exceptions need to be explicitly added using ``catch_extra_error_codes``.  Some AWS modules may see an increase in transient failures due to AWS's eventual consistency model.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Add ``aws_security_token``, ``aws_endpoint_url`` and ``endpoint_url`` aliases to improve AWS module parameter naming consistency.
- Add support for ``aws_ca_bundle`` to boto3 based AWS modules
- Add support for configuring boto3 profiles using ``AWS_PROFILE`` and ``AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE``
- Added check_mode support to aws_az_info
- Added check_mode support to ec2_eni_info
- Added check_mode support to ec2_snapshot_info
- ansible_dict_to_boto3_filter_list - convert integers and bools to strings before using them in filters.
- aws_direct_connect_virtual_interface - add direct_connect_gateway_id parameter. This field is only applicable in private VIF cases (public=False) and is mutually exclusive to virtual_gateway_id.
- cloudformation - Return change_set_id in the cloudformation output if a change set was created.
- ec2 - deprecate allowing both group and group_id - currently we ignore group_id if both are passed.
- ec2_ami_info - allow integer and bool values for filtering images (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/43570).
- ec2_asg - Add support for Max Instance Lifetime
- ec2_asg - Add the ability to use mixed_instance_policy in launch template driven autoscaling groups
- ec2_asg - Migrated to AnsibleAWSModule
- ec2_placement_group - make ``name`` a required field.
- ec2_vol_info - Code cleanup and use of the AWSRetry decorator to improve stability
- ec2_vpc_net - Enable IPv6 CIDR assignment
